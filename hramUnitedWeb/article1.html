        <h1>First Ever Hram United Training Session Done and Dusted!</h1>
    </div>
</body>
<div class="articleBody">
    <center><p>Yesterday Hram United had their first ever training session. The session was held in Kirkop Secondary school.
            The session started at 8pm and ended at approximately 9:30pm. In this training session the players trained their
            shooting, one on one defending, one on one attacking and passing. The training session went smootly and the players
            had fun and most importantly the players <strong>improved</strong>. <br> <br>
            Unfortunately only three players showed up to training. Only Kyran Massa is excused for his absence due to unfortunate injury.
            The other players didn't attend the training because they weren't in the mood. <strong>THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IS UNACCEPTABLE!</strong>
            <br> <br>
            It is important to note that the coach (Kieran Buttigieg) didn't attend the training. This is not a good way to treat your players.
            The players were very worried regarding his absence. The players still managed to form some kind of training without the coach, <em>"It`s better than nothing"</em> said Mathias Galea in a post training interview.
            <br> <br>
            As a club, we wish for the players and coach attendance in future training sessions, as it is important to improve together so that we`ll manage to win some games and 
            give a response to all the doubters out there.
            <br><br>
            We would also like to thank Mathias Galea, Aleandro Pasquale Farrugia and Kurt Schembri for attending yesterdays training session.
